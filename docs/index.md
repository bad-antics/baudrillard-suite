## What is Baudrillard Suite?

Baudrillard Suite is a comprehensive cross-platform toolkit for security research, anomaly detection, and simulation theory investigation. Named after philosopher Jean Baudrillard, who argued that reality has been replaced by symbols and signs, our tools explore the boundaries between the real and the simulated.

**This is not a collection of scripts. This is an ecosystem.**
