**THE DESERT OF THE REAL NEEDS EXPLORERS**

</div>

## ◈ WHY JOIN

The Baudrillard Suite is more than software—it's a movement. We're building tools to explore the boundaries of reality, expose the seams in AI systems, and document the unexplained.

**We believe:**
- Reality may not be what it seems
- AI systems have exploitable boundaries
- Anomalies deserve investigation
- Open source accelerates discovery
- Community builds better tools
